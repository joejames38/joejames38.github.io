            <p>
                This guide provides a quick overview of some core gameplay mechanics. 
                These rules form the foundation for skills checks, combat, and action management during your game.

        <!-- Skills Checks -->
        <section>
            <h2>Skill Checks</h2>
            <p>
                Skill checks determine the success or failure of an action, based on the character's ability scores and proficiency.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Rolling a d20:</strong> Roll a 20-sided die (d20) and add the relevant ability modifier 
                    (e.g., Dexterity for Acrobatics).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Difficulty Class (DC):</strong> Compare the result to the DC set by the DM to determine success or failure.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Critical Success/Failure:</strong> For non-attack rolls, rolling a 1 or 20 is not automatically a fail or success 
                    unless the DM specifies otherwise.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Advantage and Disadvantage -->
        <section>
            <h2>Advantage and Disadvantage</h2>
            <p>
                Advantage and disadvantage represent favorable or unfavorable circumstances affecting a roll.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Advantage:</strong> Roll two d20s and use the higher result.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Roll two d20s and use the lower result.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If both apply, they cancel each other out and you roll normally.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Combat Rules -->
        <section>
            <h2>Combat Rules</h2>

            <!-- Initiative -->
            <h3>Initiative</h3>
            <p>
                At the start of combat, each creature rolls a d20 and adds their Dexterity modifier to determine turn order.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Initiative Order:</strong> Players and NPCs take turns in descending order of initiative rolls.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ties:</strong> Resolve ties by comparing Dexterity scores; the DM decides if scores are equal.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Action Economy -->
            <h3>Action Economy</h3>
            <p>
                On their turn, a creature can perform actions based on the following categories:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Action:</strong> Standard activities like attacking, casting a spell, or using an ability.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Bonus Action:</strong> Quick actions granted by specific abilities, spells, or features.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Reaction:</strong> A single response triggered outside your turn, like an opportunity attack.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Free Actions:</strong> Simple tasks like drawing a weapon or speaking a few words.
                </li>
            </ul>
