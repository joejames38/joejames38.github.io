                    <h2>Step 1: ABC's of Character Creation</h2>
                    <p>
                        The ABC's of character creation involve:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>A:</strong> Choosing an <strong>Ancestry</strong> that defines your character's race and unique traits.</li>
                        <li><strong>B:</strong> Picking <strong>two Backgrounds</strong> that reflect your character's history and skills.</li>
                        <li><strong>C:</strong> Creating <strong>three Connections</strong> that tie your character to people, places, or events. 
									Associate <strong>1 skill</strong> that you would have gained with that connection, and take note to increase
									that skill later.
							</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Example: <strong>Kelsey the Medic</strong> chose the Human ancestry, Healer and Mountainous backgrounds, and has connections to her 
						hometown hospital (+1 Medicine), a villain named Dr. Chaos(+1 Insight), and a her gun enthusiast party member named Alex (+1 Ranged Weapons).
                    </p>
                </div>

                <!-- Slide 2: Core Ability Assignment -->
                <div class="slide">
                    <h2>Step 2: Core Ability Assignment</h2>
                    <p>
                        Assign the ability score array <strong>[3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1]</strong> to the six core stats:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Strength:</strong> Physical power</li>
                        <li><strong>Dexterity:</strong> Agility and reflexes</li>
                        <li><strong>Constitution:</strong> Endurance and resilience</li>
                        <li><strong>Intelligence:</strong> Knowledge and reasoning</li>
                        <li><strong>Wisdom:</strong> Perception and insight</li>
                        <li><strong>Charisma:</strong> Influence and charm</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Example: Kelsey is looking to be a support party member and has distributed her scores as follows:
                        Strength: 1, Dexterity: 2, Constitution: 1, Intelligence: 3, Wisdom: 3, Charisma: 2.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <!-- Slide 3: Assign Skill Points to Skills -->
                <div class="slide">
                    <h2>Step 3: Spend Skill Points(SP) on Skills and Feats</h2>
                    <p>
                        Assign the starting Skills Points <strong>24</strong> to the arrays of skills availiable.
                    </p>
					<p>
						Choose a variety of skills since you never know what the story may need to solve a mystery.
					</p>
					<p>
						Save a few Skill Points to spend on buying feats. These are much more expensive, but can be
						worth it for the added benefits.
					</p>
					<p>
						Remember you can only add skill points to skills up to the max of their associated core ability score.
					</p>
                    <p>
                        Example: Kelsey distributed her skill points as follows:
						<br>
                        Strength: 1, Dexterity: 2, Constitution: 3, Intelligence: 3, Wisdom: 2, Charisma: 1.
						<ul>
							<li>
							+2 to Iniative
							</li>
							<li>
							+1 to Ranged Weapons (Kelsey already has a +1 from her connection with Alex)
							</li>
							<li>
							+1 to Fortide
							</li>
							<li>
							+1 to Reflex (Only a small increase, but more can be spent here later)
							</li>
							<li>
							+3 to Will 
							</li>
							<li>
							+2 to Medicine (+1 from working in a hospital to a max of +3)
							</li>
							<li>
							+3 to Investigation
							</li>
							<li>
							+1 to Science (Leaving room for improvement later)
							</li>
						</ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Example: Kelsey now wants to buy a few feats.
                        <br>
						Strength: 1, Dexterity: 2, Constitution: 3, Intelligence: 3, Wisdom: 2, Charisma: 1.
						<ul>
							<li>
							Tough 1 (Cost 5SP): To gain 5 more HP and meeting the prequisite of 1+ Constitution
							</li>
							<li>
							Medic's Touch (Cost 5SP): To gain extra healing if her party needs it.
							</li>
						</ul>
                    </p>
					<p>
					Kelsey has now finished allocating her initial skill points. There will be plenty more to come later.

                <div class="slide">
                    <h2>Step 4: Equipment</h2>
                    <p>
                        Choose 1 set of Armor, Choose 1 weapon, and Choose 3 pieces of adventuring gear. Worn items don't count against your inventory limit of 10 + your Strength Score.
                    </p>
					<p>
					Some things are free to carry like a peronal items such as a wallet.
					</p>
                    <p>
                    Example: Kelsey is looking to be a ranged fighter in combat:
					<br>
                    Strength: 1, Dexterity: 2, Constitution: 1, Intelligence: 3, Wisdom: 3, Charisma: 2.
					<ul>
						<li>Light Armor DR+2</li>
						<li>Sidearm</li>
						<li>Spare Clip</li>
						<li>Flashlight</li>
						<li>Med Kit</li>
					</ul>
                    </p>
